# webAR

when I want to run an Augmented Reality application, sometimes I have to install an Android-based application which for me is very annoying because I have to download and install it first, then I found a very interesting library, namely mindar.js which allows running Augmented Reality in your browser without having to install it. any application, just open the link provided

1. Open this link https://webar-furniture.netlify.app
2. Allow websites to access your camera
3. Scan this image, yes I know it will take a little effort because it takes two devices one to scan the image and another to display the image to be scanned
